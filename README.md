# Fastq Parsers

This repository aims to provide fastq parsers implemented in multiple languages. The primary goal is to explore and familiarize myself with the syntax and peculiarities of various programming languages.

In addition to the core fastq parsing functionality, some parsers in this collection may offer additional features. Such as a sliding window sequence trimmer or a N50 read statistic.
